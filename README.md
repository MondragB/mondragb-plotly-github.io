The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Step 1: Plotly

- [x] Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

  - [x] Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

  - [x] Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

  - [x] Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

  - [x] Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

- [x] Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

  - [x] Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

  - [x] Use `sample_values` for the y values.

  - [x] Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

  - [x] Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

  - [x] Use `otu_labels` for the text values.

- [x] Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

- [x] Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

- [x] Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
